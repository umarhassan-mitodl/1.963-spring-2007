  caption: This class focused on ways to shift a population of MIT employees away
    from parking and towards public transit, including the commuter rail. One question
    raised was whether increased commuter rail subsidies encourage people to live
    in the suburbs and drive for their non-commute trips. (Photograph courtesy of
