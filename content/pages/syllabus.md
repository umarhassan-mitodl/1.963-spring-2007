Description
-----------

This seminar-style class will focus on evaluating and recommending alternative commuter and business-related transportation policies for the MIT campus. Emphasis will be placed on reducing transportation-related energy usage in a sustainable manner in response to President Hockfield's "Walk the Talk" energy initiative.

Students will explore the relative roles of MIT and the MBTA as transportation providers, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of related subsidy policies currently in place for all modes of transportation. Guest speakers will be scheduled to challenge students with innovative policy perspectives and provide valuable background information to enhance the required policy analysis.

Course requirements will include individual background research, readings and technical analyses leading towards a portion of a final, unified course written report and presentation on recommended alternative policies.
